The fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur. The situation is spiraling out of control, with farmers running out of time to plant crops and medical supplies becoming scarce. The war has caused over 1 million people to cross into neighboring countries, while an estimated 3.4 million people have been displaced within Sudan itself. The conflict began in April over tensions linked to a planned transition to civilian rule, exposing civilians to daily battles and attacks. The UN estimates that over 4,000 people have been killed, and reports of sexual assaults have increased by 50%. Large parts of the country have also been suffering from an electricity blackout and mobile network outages.",0,0,0.0,1,1,0,0

However, before communities can begin to heal, tons of charred debris will need to be removed from the island. The cleanup process is expected to be daunting, costly, and time-consuming, potentially taking years.

Trump is facing charges for pushing illegal schemes to overturn the 2020 election results. Despite the detailed indictment against him, Trump and his allies have portrayed his actions as a matter of free speech. However, former Department of Justice officials, scholars, and ex-Republican House members argue that Trump's actions went beyond free speech and are weakening the justice system. They also warn that embracing Trump's free-speech claims could lead to the spread of new conspiracy theories. Critics believe that Trump's allies are using the defense to appeal to the party's base and justify their support for him. The indictment against Trump includes evidence of his active role in illegal attempts to overturn the election, despite no evidence of widespread fraud.

HBCUs have a history of valuing inclusion and welcoming students from diverse backgrounds. They have a higher percentage of non-Black students compared to the past, with a quarter of students in 2021 being non-Black. HBCUs also enroll more students from low-income backgrounds and are more likely to admit students who haven't taken advanced courses in high school, which can be a barrier for students of color.

BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and outperform existing discrete diffusion models in language modeling tasks. The network inputs for discrete data are differentiable, allowing for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains.

	Saying Hello Linked to Higher Wellbeing, but With Limits 
","A study conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge found that saying hello to strangers is linked to higher wellbeing. The study involved participants who were instructed to either say hello or remain silent as they passed by strangers in public places. The results showed that those who said hello reported feeling happier and more connected to their community. However, the study also found that there are limits to the benefits of saying hello. When participants were asked to say hello to a large number of strangers, the positive effects diminished. This suggests that there is a threshold for the number of social interactions that can contribute to wellbeing. The researchers believe that these findings highlight the importance of small acts of kindness and social connections in daily life. They suggest that even brief interactions with strangers can have a positive impact on mental health and social cohesion. Additionally, a Gallup study found that regularly greeting multiple neighbors in the neighborhood is linked to higher wellbeing among adults in the U.S. The study showed that the wellbeing score of Americans increases as the number of neighbors greeted increases, with a peak at greeting six neighbors. Beyond six neighbors, there is no significant increase in wellbeing.

The spikes occurred in clusters, with multiple sensors spiking simultaneously while others nearby showed no spike. If the spikes were caused by trucks stirring up radioactive dirt, the radiation levels would not have dropped so quickly. Despite the concerning findings, there has been little interest in investigating the issue further.

However, expiring the session after a short period of inactivity may not prevent session takeover, as attackers can immediately use stolen session tokens to gain access. The article also mentions the potential risk of shared computers and compromised devices, but states that for most web applications, the threat of shared public computers is not realistic.

Scientists have found evidence of a magnetic field reversal occurring about 42,000 years ago, much more recent than the previously estimated 780,000 years ago. This finding raises concerns about the potential impact of a magnetic field reversal on modern technology and society.

Summary 2: The Earth's magnetic field has weakened by about 9% over the past 170 years, according to satellite data. This weakening could be a sign of an upcoming magnetic field reversal, which occurs when the magnetic north and south poles switch places. Such a reversal could have significant consequences for our planet, including increased exposure to solar radiation and disruption of modern technology that relies on the magnetic field.

Summary 3: Scientists have discovered that the Earth's magnetic field is weakening 10 times faster than previously believed. The magnetic field protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and helps guide animal migrations. If the weakening continues at this rate, it could lead to a complete reversal of the magnetic poles within the next 2,000 years.

Fixing the TPM: Hardware Security Modules Done Right
","The author of the text criticizes the TPM2.0 for being a bloated mess and overly complex. They argue that the TPM's hardware is a tiny general-purpose computer and suggest that allowing users to run arbitrary programs would simplify the TPM. However, they acknowledge the challenge of preventing users from loading code that extracts the TPM's secret. The author then introduces Microsoft Research's solution called DICE measured boot, which limits access to the device secret and instead gives derived secrets to the main program. This solution involves a main program, a bootloader, a key derivation function, a unique device secret, a compound device identity, and a latch. The boot sequence ensures that only the bootloader can read the device secret, and if the main program leaks its derived secret, fixing the vulnerability automatically changes the derived secret.

50e97442-9141-45e7-b515-9e682cd1a188,Meaningful Exits for Founders. For an industry that doesn’t do it for… | by Bryce Roberts | Strong Words | Medium,"In the world of startups, money is often talked about despite the industry not being driven by it. Samuel Gil's post discusses what constitutes a meaningful exit for venture capitalists (VCs). According to his calculations, a meaningful exit should be able to return 33% of a VC's fund, while a home run exit should return the entire fund in a single investment. Founder dilution is another important aspect, as analyzed by Capshare. Their research suggests that founder ownership decreases predictably based on the rounds raised by a company. For example, at a Series D exit, founders can expect to own around 11-17% of the company, while investors own 66-68%.

Chiang was born in China in 1946 but moved to Taiwan with his family in 1948. He faced challenging conditions in Taiwan, particularly in the competitive school system. He attended National Taiwan University and later transferred to Stanford University to complete his PhD in electrical engineering. Chiang worked at ITT and Texas Instruments before joining Hewlett Packard in 1980. At HP, he gained experience in CMOS, CCD, and bipolar technologies. However, as HP's competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing declined, Chiang received an offer to become VP R&D at TSMC in 1997. He played a crucial role in making TSMC a leader in the industry. Chiang retired from TSMC in 2006 but returned in 2009 to focus on transistor leadership and advanced packaging. He later joined the board of SMIC but eventually left. The oral history provides valuable insights into the growth and dominance of TSMC in the semiconductor foundry business.",1,0,0.061926101689302106,0,1,0,0

Howard,"The author of the article recounts a discussion they had with someone about undefined behavior (UB) in programming languages like C and C++. The person they were talking to had a different understanding of UB, believing that compilers can assume UB does not exist and optimize accordingly. The author, who is a language designer and compiler author, disagrees with this perspective. They argue that compiler authors should not have the freedom to do whatever they want with UB because most programmers prioritize correctness over performance. The author gives examples of optimizations made by compilers like Clang and GCC that surprise programmers and go against their expectations of how their code should run. They conclude that compiler authors have intentionally pushed a definition of UB that differs from the understanding of most programmers.",1,0,0.05908265643318051,0,1,0,0

Slavery was still prevalent in the colonies despite the outlawing of the transatlantic slave trade in 1807. Conditions on the sugar plantations in Demerara, British Guiana, were particularly harsh, with brutal labor, violence, and suppression of African culture. The rebellion, led by enslaved African Jack Gladstone, began with the goal of improving working conditions and quickly spread across the province, involving around 13,000 Africans on 60 plantations. However, the revolt was met with brutal repression by British soldiers. On August 20, 200 enslaved Africans were killed, and many others were tortured and killed as well. Jack's father, Quamina, was captured and executed, and Jack himself was exiled to St. Lucia.

Directed by Cory Finley and based on a novel by M. T. Anderson, the movie takes place in the 2030s, where an alien race known as the Vuuv has arrived on Earth, bringing advanced technology and wealth, but only for the human elite. The story follows Adam, a high school student and artist, who forms a relationship with Chloe, a girl from a struggling family. Chloe comes up with the idea of livestreaming her dates with Adam, which the Vuuv find fascinating due to their lack of understanding of romantic love. The livestream becomes a source of income but also leads to degradation for Adam. The film effectively portrays the economic depression caused by the alien invasion, with subtle worldbuilding and believable scenarios of wealth inequality. However, the story becomes muddled as it progresses, with a sitcom-like compromise and some funny moments.

However, not having an RSS feed means giving up control of traffic to search engines and social platforms. RSS allows bloggers to establish a direct communication channel with readers, bypassing gatekeepers like Google and Facebook. Even if only a minority of readers subscribe to the RSS feed, they are the engaged superfans who share the blogger's work and provide opportunities for collaboration. Two objections to RSS feeds are that they prevent monetization through ads and make content stealing easier. However, bloggers can provide partial RSS feeds that require readers to visit the blog for full access, addressing the ad monetization concern.

7184b804-ea48-4a0b-8b9d-522f17ac0ff4,Conclusive Evidence for Modified Gravity: Collapse of Newton’s and Einstein’s Theories in Low Acceleration,"A recent study on wide binaries has provided conclusive evidence for the breakdown of standard gravity at low accelerations. Researchers analyzed data from 26,500 wide binaries and found deviations from Newton's and Einstein's gravitational laws when accelerations were below one nanometer per second squared. These deviations align with a modified theory called MOND, proposed 40 years ago. The study also found that the observed boost of accelerations at lower accelerations is predicted by a MOND-type Lagrangian theory of gravity called AQUAL. The wide binary data suggest a breakdown of Newtonian dynamics and the manifestation of the external field effect of modified gravity. These findings have profound implications for astrophysics, theoretical physics, and cosmology. Confirmation by independent analyses will be necessary to further validate these results. The study challenges current concepts of dark matter and could lead to a revolution in physics, as it suggests that a large amount of dark matter may not be necessary.",0,0,0.0,1,1,1,0

They have developed technologies that are often decades ahead of what is available in the private sector. Some of these technologies have been declassified and released to the public. One example is the lithium-iodine battery, which was created in the 1960s to improve the performance of surveillance equipment and reconnaissance satellites. The technology was later passed on to the medical community and is now used in devices such as pacemakers, cell phones, and digital cameras. Another example is Google Earth, which was originally developed by a CIA-funded venture-capital firm. The technology transformed the way intelligence officers interacted with geographic information and earth imagery and was eventually acquired by Google. Additionally, the CIA's advanced image-processing techniques used for missile detection have also been applied to breast cancer detection.

It was originally developed as a reliable and inexpensive system for loading instructions and software updates into mainframe computers. The first floppies were 8-inch disks that were packaged in slim and durable envelopes to protect them from getting dirty. IBM began selling floppy disk drives in 1971 and received patents for the drive and floppy disk in 1972. The capacity of a single disk was equivalent to 3,000 punched cards, and IBM adapted its punched card data entry machines to work with the floppy disks. In the late 1970s, microcomputers started using floppy disks as the main method of data storage. The floppy disk played a significant role in enabling the PC revolution and the growth of the software industry. However, with the advancement of technology, floppy disks have become obsolete and are now mainly found in old desk drawers and filing cabinets.

1bc884c5-a84c-4168-873a-d7b4133f5e18,Why Do Old Books Smell So Good? – ScienceSwitch,"Old books have a distinct smell due to the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they decay over time. The specific VOCs depend on the paper, inks, and binding materials used, giving each book its unique scent. New books, on the other hand, have a crisper and fresher smell because they use different chemicals during manufacturing that produce different VOCs as they break down. Scientists can analyze the VOCs from an old book to determine its age, condition, and even its manufacturing origins. They can also identify degradation and preservation needs. Librarians and historians use VOC analysis to study collections and match orphaned books with their original libraries based on chemical fingerprints. The VOCs can also provide clues about a book's exposure to elements like smoke or water.

82b2b23d-86fa-4706-9682-03ff1e4e16b6,Cloud tenancy types to suit everyone | by Tim Bannister | The Scale Factory | Medium,"The article discusses different types of cloud tenancy in software-as-a-service (SaaS) models. The first type is individual platforms, where each customer has their own separate deployment of the system, similar to a silo. The second type is pooled resources, where all tenants share the same infrastructure, which is a common approach in cloud computing. The third type is hybrid tenancies, which combine elements of both individual platforms and pooled resources. 

The article also highlights the importance of choosing the right tenancy model based on the organization's needs and history. For cloud-native products, tenancy decisions need to be made before launching a minimum viable product. For organizations that previously offered on-premises applications, transitioning to the cloud may involve deploying the entire application for each tenant initially, and later migrating to a pooled approach. 

The article emphasizes the need for scalability and stability in cloud infrastructure, especially for SaaS vendors in industries like finance. The demand for the application may vary throughout the year, so having an infrastructure with enough elasticity is crucial. Overall, the article provides insights into the different cloud tenancy types and their suitability for various organizations.",1,0,0.715602336192093,0,1,0,0

Great white shark duo appear to be travelling together | CBC Radio,"Two great white sharks, named Jekyll and Simon, have been observed traveling together in a synchronized manner, challenging the belief that these predators are solitary creatures. The sharks were tagged off the coast of Georgia in December 2022 and have been tracked by marine scientists at Ocearch. They have followed a similar migratory route from Georgia to New England, Maine, and into Canada, where they have spent the summer hunting off the coasts of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Although they are not swimming side-by-side, the sharks are consistently within a few kilometers of each other. The scientists suspect that Jekyll and Simon may be genetically related, possibly even brothers, as they are both juvenile males of approximately the same age. Tissue samples have been taken from both sharks for DNA testing.

In the case of a viral track with AI-generated voices of Drake and the Weeknd, UMG issued takedown requests to YouTube due to a copyrighted sample. Google and other AI companies argue that these copies are permissible fair use under the Copyright Act. However, fair use is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in the courts, leading to inconsistent outcomes. Google needs to keep the music industry happy as YouTube relies on blanket licenses from labels.",1,1,0.029771972988613615,0,1,0,0

It is not the groundbreaking phone that Nothing claims it to be, but it offers solid performance and a fair price. The phone is not coming to the US and will be available in the UK, parts of Europe, India, and Japan. The Phone 1's light strips, called glyphs, blink in combinations tied to corresponding sounds. Users can set a glyph for all incoming notifications or get more specific by assigning different glyphs to individual contacts or app notifications. This feature allows users to triage notifications without details flashing across the screen. Overall, the glyph notification system is a less obtrusive way to stay informed. However, the phone's battery life is average, and it does not come with a charger. Nothing does not have a track record of success yet, but the Phone 1 offers a good user experience with its snappy performance and smooth-scrolling OLED screen.",0,0,0.0,1,1,0,0

The 6.7-inch 1080p screen is one of the nicest in its price range, capable of running up to 120Hz. The overall build feels durable with Gorilla Glass on the front and back and sturdy aluminum rails.

The company's previous warranty explicitly excluded burned-in images resulting from improper usage, and when questioned about burn-in coverage, LG did not provide a clear answer. However, after four months of conversations with The Verge, LG Electronics has now introduced a two-year burn-in warranty for its OLED gaming monitor in the US. The new warranty applies retroactively to any LG 27GR95QE-B monitors that have already been sold. Although the warranty technically states that LG will only cover normal and proper use, and excludes damage or failure resulting from misuse or abuse, LG's product marketing director clarified that burn-in is covered as long as the monitor is used as intended (personal PC monitor) in a residential setting. This change is significant as evidence of burn-in damage is often considered evidence of abuse, and many companies deny warranty service on this basis.

However, the crisis shattered this consensus and the public's trust. Studies showed that trade liberalization had adverse effects on poverty reduction in rural India, but empirical evidence was met with skepticism. The accusation was that the policymaking elites benefited from cheap imported goods and couldn't be trusted on trade.

The dirt used for the tracks is sourced from different locations and needs to be the right texture and pH balance. Monster Jam's senior director of dirt, Daniel Allen, knows that each type of dirt is different and prefers a mix of clay and sand. The dirt crew hauls in hundreds of truckloads of dirt for each venue and sculpts it into ramps and jumps. The best loader operators can shape the ramps with precision. Monster truckers are obsessed with the type of dirt they drive on and the size of the tires on the trucks. The appeal of monster trucks is the love for big things and the American desire for excess. The land and terrain in America have played a role in the development of monster trucks.

The government's attempt to stabilize the real estate market with a modest decline in interest rates has been underwhelming. Lower interest rates are unlikely to solve systemic problems in real estate and finance when the issue is not high interest rates. The yuan exchange rate is under pressure, and there are concerns about capital outflows despite regulations. Stock prices are at their lowest level since the end of 2022, reflecting a lack of confidence among households, investors, and private firms. The real estate market is the main cause of China's economic troubles, with transaction volumes and home prices falling. Evergrande, a major property developer, has filed for bankruptcy protection, and Country Garden, once seen as a model corporate citizen, has defaulted on international bond obligations.

The interview with Carlson is not expected to touch on Trump's legal issues, as Carlson believes these matters have already been sufficiently litigated. However, Trump's habit of lashing out at prosecutors and potential witnesses in the cases has led to protective orders and warnings from federal judges.

Initially, authorities claimed that Irizarry had lunged at officers with a knife, but newly released surveillance video contradicts this. Police commissioner Danielle Outlaw announced that officer Mark Dial, who shot and killed Irizarry while he was sitting in his car, will be suspended and eventually fired for refusing to cooperate in the investigation. Outlaw stated that the initial account of events was not accurate and that Irizarry was driving erratically and going the wrong way down a one-way street before pulling into a parking spot. The revised police statement indicates that Irizarry was shot while inside his vehicle, not outside as previously claimed. The police have recovered two knives from the car, but Irizarry's aunt suggests that he used them as tools for working on cars.

The coup exposed the fragility of Putin's regime and raised questions about how the Russian leader would respond. Prigozhin's rebellion resulted in the shooting down of helicopters and the death of Russian service personnel. Despite promising to ""liquidate the traitor,"" Putin allowed Prigozhin to strike a deal with Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and go into exile. Putin even had a three-hour meeting with Prigozhin and Wagner group commanders after the mutiny. Prigozhin was seen moving freely between Moscow and St. Petersburg, reportedly collecting cash and gold bars from his mansions. He was also spotted at a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg, where he met African officials at a hotel he owned.

Prigozhin had been trying to regain influence by supporting a coup in Niger and recruiting for operations in Africa. However, it seems that his actions were not enough to save him. Reports suggest that Prigozhin was flying back from Africa with other Wagner leaders when the plane crashed, possibly shot down by Russian air defenses.

The article then provides an implementation of an atomic tuple class in Java, which includes a version field needed for the seqlock. The write() method of the class uses a spinlock to prevent concurrent writes and applies a given function to the current tuple state. It then increments the version to indicate that there is no ongoing write. The article concludes by mentioning that the code uses acquire/release memory semantics and provides a link to a post explaining these semantics.",1,0,0.22160998846031044,0,1,0,0

They reference McKinsey's report on the limited success of payment systems introduced between 1993 and 2000, with PayPal being one of the few standout successes. The Financial Times also weighs in, stating that the payments industry may not be able to dominate the world due to various challenges such as competition, network effects, and technical debt.

129635d7-59c1-436d-be22-87e5648ce0c0,This isn't the way to speed up Rust compile times - Xe Iaso,"The text discusses the use of the serde library in Rust for serializing and deserializing data structures. Serde provides tooling for encoding and decoding data in various formats. Unlike other approaches, serde does not prefer a specific encoding format. It achieves this by implementing the Deserialize and Serialize traits on the data types, which pushes the reflection data normally inspected at runtime into compile-time data. This makes the code run faster and more deterministically, but increases compile time. The author believes this tradeoff is worth it because it improves the developer experience. In comparison, Go requires developers to declare encoding and decoding rules for each codec individually, leading to repetitive and error-prone code. The article also mentions a recent decision in serde to use a precompiled version of a procedural macro to speed up compile times, but the author disagrees with this approach due to the inherent risks of using precompiled binaries. Serde is widely used and convenient, but it has downsides such as its reliance on procedural macros and the performance cost it incurs during build times.",0,0,0.0,1,1,0,0

    Power consumption of JPEG, WebP, and AVIF - Fershad Irani
","The text discusses the power consumption of different image formats, specifically JPEG, WebP, and AVIF. The author wanted to determine how much power is used on a device when loading an image and whether modern formats with smaller file sizes are also less power hungry. To test this, the author created web pages that load a single image in each format and measured the power consumption using the Firefox Profiler. The tests were conducted on a local machine using Firefox Nightly browser on an Apple Silicon-powered MacBook. The results showed that WebP and AVIF consumed less power compared to JPEG when loading and rendering the images. The smaller file sizes of WebP and AVIF allowed for faster transfer over the network and quicker visibility on the user's device.

Previously, it was believed that black holes could spin at any speed, but a new study suggests that they have a maximum limit. The researchers found that as black holes spin faster, they emit more energy in the form of gravitational waves. However, there is a point at which the energy emission levels off, indicating that the black hole has reached its maximum speed. This discovery challenges current theories about the behavior of black holes and could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. It suggests that there may be fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of black holes, similar to how there are laws that govern the behavior of other celestial bodies.
